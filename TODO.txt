- [X] Add environment-dependent configuration:
      - Implement different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.
      - Ensure the application loads the correct configuration based on the environment.

- [ ] Add encryption/decryption for sensitive data:
      - Implement encryption for storing sensitive data in the database.
      - BE -> Secret Key
      - FE -> Public Key 

- [ ] Add social media login/subscription functionality (Facebook/Instagram/Google):
      - Integrate OAuth authentication for Facebook, Instagram, and Google.
      - Implement subscription handling for each social media platform.

- [ ] Add HTTPS support:
      - Configure the server to use HTTPS for secure communication.
      - Obtain and install SSL/TLS certificates.
      - Update the application to use HTTPS endpoints.

- [X] Expose API to enable other microservices to download the JWT parsing key from Keycloak:
      - /v1/token/jwks
      - Require NO AUTH
      - Create an API endpoint for retrieving the JWT parsing key from Keycloak.
      - Secure the endpoint to ensure only authorized microservices can access it.

- [X] Review the logic of the authentication middleware
      - Does it make sense to always call keycloak? -> No, it'll generate overhead
      - Does it make sense to download the public key at service initialization and then use it in the middleware, without having to call keycloak?
            
- [ ] Add user email verification
